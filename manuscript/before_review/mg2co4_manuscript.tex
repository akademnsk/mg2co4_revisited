\begin{abstract}
Orthocarbonates of alkaline-earth metals are the newly discovered class of compounds stabilized at high pressures.
Orthocarbonates of Ca and Mg are the potential carbon host phases, transferring oxidized carbon in the Earth's lower mantle up to the core-mantle boundary.
Here, we demonstrate the possibility for the formation of Mg$_2$CO$_4$ in the lower mantle at pressures above 50 GPa, by {\it ab initio} calculations.
Mg$_2$CO$_4$ is formed by the reaction MgCO$_3$ + MgO = Mg$_2$CO$_4$, proceeding only at high-temperatures.
At 50 GPa the reaction starts at 2200 K.
The temperature decreases with pressure and drops down to 1085 K at the pressure of the Earth's core-mantle boundary, near 140 GPa.
Two stable structures, Mg$_2$CO$_4$-$Pnma$ and Mg$_2$CO$_4$-$P2_1/c$, were revealed. 
Mg$_2$CO$_4$-$Pnma$ is isostructural to Mg$_2$SiO$_4$ (forsterite) and stable below 80 GPa.
Mg$_2$CO$_4$-$P$2$_1$/$c$ is isostructural to $\beta$-Ca$_2$SiO$_4$ (larnite) and stable above this pressure.
Mg$_2$CO$_4$-$Pnma$ has a melting temperature of 16-18 \% higher  than the melting temperature of  MgCO$_3$ (magnesite).
At 23.7 GPa and 35.5 GPa, Mg$_2$CO$_4$-$Pnma$  melts at 2742 K and 2819 K, respectively.
Acoustic wave velocities $Vp$ and $Vs$ of Mg$_2$CO$_4$-$Pnma$ are very similar to that of magnesite, while orthocarbonate owns stronger universal anisotropy in comparison with carbonate and has a larger coefficient $A^U$.

\section*{Introduction}

During the recent decade, the crystal structure prediction technique became an integral part of high-pressure research. 
Numerous interesting experimental synthesis were guided by this technique, for instance, the synthesis of the high-pressure phases of alkaline carbonates Li$_2$CO$_3$, Na$_2$CO$_3$, and K$_2$CO$_3$ \cite{gavr2016, gavr2019_alk, grzechnik2003}  and alkaline-earth carbonates CaCO$_3$, MgCO$_3$, and CaMg(CO$_3$)$_2$ \cite{oganov2006, pickard2015, gavr2017_aragII, smith2018, solomatova2017_fedol, binck2020_dol, merlini2017_dol}.
 
Orthocarbonates are another example for experimental confirmation of theoretically predicted structures.
The possibility for the synthesis of alkaline orthocarbonates, the salts of the not yet experimentally observed orthocarbonic acid, has been suggested from the theoretical considerations \cite{alshemali2002, cancarevich2007}.
However, these predictions are still unverified by the experiment.
The stability of the alkaline-earth orthocarbonates has not been considered till the last year.
The performed crystal structure prediction in the MgO -- CO$_2$ and CaO -- CO$_2$ systems have revealed $sp^3$-bonded structures with the intermediate stoichiometries,  Ca$_3$CO$_5$ and CaC$_2$O$_5$, stabilized at high pressures \cite{yao2018}. 
Thermodynamically stable structures of orthocarbonates with the Сa$_2$CO$_4$ or Mg$_2$CO$_4$ stoichiometry  have not been revealed in these calculations.

Assuming the stochastic nature of the used methods of crystal structure prediction and possibility that some favorable structures can be missed in the calculation, we have performed a thorough search using both evolutionary algorithms (USPEX) and {\it ab initio} random methods (AIRSS) within the stoichiometry of orthocarbonate M$_2$CO$_4$, where M is alkaline-earth metal, Mg, Ca, Sr, or Ba.
As the result of this investigation, the structure Ca$_2$CO$_4$-$Pnma$ was obtained \cite{sagatova2020_ortho}.
This structure lies above the energetic convex hull in the CaO -- CO$_2$ system, i.e. it is stable relative to the decomposition on the known phases of this system, in particular to the mixture of CaO+CaCO$_3$.
Further theoretical search has also shown that the similar structures of Sr and Ba orthocarbonates, Sr$_2$CO$_4$-$Pnma$ and Ba$_2$CO$_4$-$Pnma$, are also stable \cite{gavr2020_htxrd}. 
Recent experimental synthesis combined with single-crystal X-ray structure solution have confirmed the stability of the predicted Ca$_2$CO$_4$-$Pnma$ and Sr$_2$CO$_4$-$Pnma$ structures \cite{laniel2021}.

Undoubtedly, the most interesting orthocarbonate for the Earth sciences is the orthocarbonate of Mg. 
This compound can be readily formed within the slab subducted in the Earth's lower mantle from the locally abundant MgCO$_3$ and MgO by the simple reaction MgCO$_3$ + MgO = Mg$_2$CO$_4$.
In the present study, using crystal structure prediction techniques, we performed the search of the structures in the composition Mg$_2$CO$_4$ and revealed the structure, having the chances to be formed at the Earth's lower mantle $P$--$T$ conditions.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
		\section*{Methods}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To increase the chances for finding the energetically favorable structures we have used both USPEX and AIRSS methods, each of which has apparent advantages \cite{oganov2019}.
{\it Ab initio} structure prediction was complemented by the prediction technique based on the known structures of silicates and sulfates with isolated [SiO$_4$] and [SO$_4$] tetrahedrons. 
Mg$_2$CO$_4$ structures were produced from these structures by the corresponding replacement of the cations and consequent local optimizations.
The following crystal structures have been used (numbers in parentheses indicate the number of formula units (f.u.) in the unit cell): Zn$_2$SiO$_4$-$Fd\bar{3}m$ (8), Zn$_2$SiO$_4$-$Imma$ (8), Zn$_2$SiO$_4$-$Pbca$ (8), Zn$_2$SiO$_4$-$Pnma$ (4), Zn$_2$SiO$_4$-$I\bar{4}2d$ (4) \cite{kanzaki2019}, Mg$_2$SiO$_4$-$Pnma$ (4) \cite{smyth1973}, Na$_2$SO$_4$-$Fddd$ (8) \cite{hawthorne1975}, Li$_2$SO$_4$-$P2_1/c$ (4) \cite{alcock1973}, and Ca$_2$CO$_4$-$Pnma$ (4) \cite{sagatova2020_ortho}.
 
The calculations with the USPEX method \cite{uspex1,uspex2,uspex3,uspex_topology} have been performed for 1-4 f.u. of Mg$_2$CO$_4$ at 25, 50, and 100 GPa.
The seeding technique, implemented in version 10.2 of the USPEX, has been employed in all calculations.
The aforementioned structures of silicates, sulfates, and orthocarbonate have been used as the seeds.
Totally, around 3000 structures have been calculated at each pressure.
Crystal structure prediction with AIRSS 0.9.1 \cite{airss1,airss2} has been performed only at 50 GPa for 2, 3, and 4 f.u. and a total of nearly 4000 structures have been generated in this calculation.

The energetic optimizations of the predicted structures have been performed within density functional theory (DFT), implemented in the VASP package \cite{vasp1,vasp2}.

To take into account the temperature effect and calculate $P$--$T$ phase diagram, we used the lattice dynamics method within the quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA).
For this task, the lattice vibration frequencies were calculated with the PHONOPY code \cite{phonopy}.
By our experience with $P$--$T$ phase diagrams of carbonates, this technique reliably reproduces phase boundaries in the wide temperature range \cite{gavr2019_alk, gavr2020_disarag, sagatova2020_ortho}, up to 80-90 \% of the melting temperature, if the process of dynamical disordering does not take place.

Melting temperatures of the predicted structures have been determined, using the so-called {\it Z-method}, based on the molecular dynamic (MD) simulations \cite{z-method}.

To determine the wave velocities $V_p$ and $V_s$ and assess anisotropy of Mg-orthocarbonates, static elastic stiffness tensor ($C_{ij}$) was calculated from the stress ($\sigma$)- strain ($\epsilon$) relation $\sigma_i=C_{ij}\epsilon_j$.
Based on these $C_{ij}$ data, we calculated averages of bulk (B) and shear (G) moduli using the Voigt-Ruess-Hill scheme \cite{hill1952,hill1963}.
 Then we have determined compression ($A_B$), shear ($A_G$), and universal anisotropy ($A^U$) indexes.

The details of DFT, crystal structure predictions, thermodynamic and elastic property calculations, and MD simulations are given in {\it Supporting information}.

FindSym program \cite{stokes2005} and instruments of Phonopy package have been used for the symmetry determination.
VESTA and ToposPro \cite{vesta,topos} programs have been used for the visualization of the crystal structures and figures preparation.
The topology of the structures was analysed with ToposPro and Robocrystallographer programs \cite{topos,robocrys}.

			\section{Results and discussion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 
In the crystal structure prediction calculations at 25 and 50 GPa, USPEX has revealed the Mg$_2$CO$_4$-$Pnma$ structure as the most energetically favorable.
This structure has lower enthalpy than Mg$_2$CO$_4$-$Cm$, predicted by AIRSS, and structures, obtained based on the crystal structures of silicates and sulfates (Figure \ref{E-P} and \ref{E-P_supp}).

At 100 GPa, USPEX has found another favorable structure with monoclinic symmetry, Mg$_2$CO$_4$-$P2_1/c$.
The transition from Mg$_2$CO$_4$-$Pnma$ to Mg$_2$CO$_4$-$P2_1/c$ occurs at 52 GPa, and at higher pressures Mg$_2$CO$_4$-$P2_1/c$ is the most energetically favorable among considered structures (Figure \ref{E-P} and \ref{E-P_supp}).

	\caption{Enthalpy-pressure dependencies of Mg$_2$CO$_4$ structures. Isostructural compounds are indicated in brackets.} \label{E-P}
\end{figure}


Revealed Mg$_2$CO$_4$-$Pnma$ is isostructural to the mineral forsterite (Figure \ref{str}a,b).
Atoms in both positions Mg1 and Mg2 are 6-coordinated, with the octahedral coordination polyhedron (Figure \ref{str}c).

is isostructural to Mg$_2$SiO$_4$ (mineral forsterite) and it is not isostructural to Ca$_2$CO$_4$-$Pnma$. 
In the crystal structure of Ca$_2$CO$_4$-$Pnma$, Ca is coordinated by 9 or 11 oxygen atoms, while in Mg$_2$CO$_4$-$Pnma$ all the Mg are 6-coordinated, with the octahedral coordination polyhedron (Figure \ref{str}a).


Mg$_2$CO$_4$-$P2_1/c$ is isostructural to $\beta$-Ca$_2$SiO$_4$ (larnite) and can be considered as the monoclinic analogue of Ca$_2$CO$_4$-$Pnma$.
In crystal structure of Mg$_2$CO$_4$-$P2_1/c$, there are two non-equivalent Mg sites. 
In the first site, Mg(1) is bonded to eight oxygen atoms, forming relatively regular square antiprism, while in the second site Mg(2) is bonded to six oxygen atoms, arranged in highly deformed trigonal prism  (Figure \ref{str}b).
Thus, transition from Mg$_2$CO$_4$-$Pnma$ to Mg$_2$CO$_4$-$P2_1/c$ is accompanied by the increase of coordination number from six to eight and six.
At the transition, the volume  decreases on 5.7 \% (Figure \ref{V-P}).

Structural data for the Mg$_2$CO$_4$-$Pnma$ and Mg$_2$CO$_4$-$P2_1/c$ are given in the Table \ref{t:str}.
Both structures are dynamically stable in the investigated pressure range 25-140 GPa, and there are no imaginary frequencies in their phonon dispersion curves (Figure \ref{phon_mg2co4_main}, \ref{phon_mg2co4_supp}). In the {\it Supporting information}, we have also shown phonon dispersion curves of MgCO$_3$ and MgO (Figure \ref{phon_mgco3}) used for the construction of $P$--$T$ phase diagram.

As Mg$_2$CO$_4$-$Pnma$ is isostructural to $\gamma$-Ca$_2$SiO$_4$ (olivine-type) and Mg$_2$CO$_4$-$P$2$_1$/$c$ --- to $\beta$-Ca$_2$SiO$_4$, the transition Mg$_2$CO$_4$-$Pnma$ $\to$ Mg$_2$CO$_4$-$P$2$_1$/$c$ is the analogue of the transition $\gamma$-Ca$_2$SiO$_4$ $\to$ $\beta$-Ca$_2$SiO$_4$, realized on compression \cite{belmonte2017}. 
For Ca$_2$SiO$_4$, it was experimentally shown, that on heating $\beta$-Ca$_2$SiO$_4$ is transformed into another phase denoted as $\alpha_H'$  (Figure \ref{ca2sio4_pt}).
This $\alpha_H'$ phase is isostructural to Ca$_2$CO$_4$-$Pnma$.
Based on this similarity, the analogue of the transition $\beta$-Ca$_2$SiO$_4$ $\to$ $\alpha_H'$-Ca$_2$SiO$_4$ can be suggested for Mg$_2$CO$_4$.
In this case, Mg$_2$CO$_4$-$P2_1/c$ will be transformed in the new hypothetical phase Mg$_2$CO$_4$-$Pnma$-II on heating.
The performed calculations of phonon dispersion curves of Mg$_2$CO$_4$-$Pnma$-II have shown the dynamical instability of this phase (Figure \ref{phon_PnmaII}).
However, the stabilization of the structure by the factors, which are not considered within QHA can not be excluded.


\begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{phon_mg} \centering
	\caption{Phonon dispersion curves of Mg$_2$CO$_4$-$Pnma$ at 50 GPa (a) and Mg$_2$CO$_4$-$P2_1/c$ at 75 GPa (b).} 	\label{phon_mg2co4_main}
\end{figure}

The performed enthalpy calculations of the Mg$_2$CO$_4$, MgO, and MgCO$_3$ structures have shown, that both Mg$_2$CO$_4$-$Pnma$ and Mg$_2$CO$_4$-$P2_1/c$ lie above the energetic convex hull, i.e. they are unstable and decompose to the mixture (MgO+MgCO$_3$) at 0 K (Figure \ref{conv_hull}). 

However, performed calculations of the Gibbs free energies in the temperature range of 0--3000 K have shown that above some temperature  Mg$_2$CO$_4$ became more energetically favorable than the (MgO+MgCO$_3$) mixture (Figure \ref{gibbs}).
At 20 GPa, this temperature is 2420 K, which is nearly equal to the melting temperature of MgCO$_3$-$R\bar{3}c$ (magnesite) \cite{solopova2015} (Figure \ref{phdia}).
The pressure decreases the temperature of transition, and at 140 GPa Mg$_2$CO$_4$-$P$2$_1$/$c$ can be synthesized from (MgO+MgCO$_3$) at temperatures higher than 1085 K.
Thus, in the pressure range of 50--140 GPa, Mg$_2$CO$_4$ is formed at temperatures 250--1100 K higher than the corresponding temperatures of MgCO$_3$ melting (Figure \ref{phdia}). 
It suggests the possibility for the formation of Mg-orthocarbonate in most part of the Earth's lower mantle, at pressures higher than 50 GPa.

\label{phdia}
\end{figure}

To assess the effect of Mg-orthocarbonate formation on the melting of MgCO$_3$, we have estimated melting temperatures of Mg-orthocarbonate.
The obtained values of the Mg$_2$CO$_4$-$Pnma$ melting temperatures at 23.7 GPa and at 35.5 GPa are 2742 K and 2819 K, respectively (Figure \ref{Zcurve}).
These values are 16-18 \% higher than the experimentally measured melting temperatures of magnesite  and comparable with solidi of silicate rocks under lower mantle P-T conditions \cite{litasov2018_review}.
The melting curve of Mg$_2$CO$_4$-$Pnma$ is nearly parallel to the melting curve of magnesite, with the difference in temperature being around 500 K.


To assess the effect of orthocarbonate formation on the seismic properties of carbonate, we have also calculated the elastic stiffness tensor and compressional/shear sound velocities ($V_p$/$V_s$) for Mg-carbonate and Mg-orthocarbonate.
We have not aimed the investigation of trends for the changes of elastic properties on compression or their description during $Pnma$ $\to$ $P2_1/c$ transition, but only the rough comparison of carbonate and orthocarbonate properties.
By this reason, calculations have been performed only at 50 GPa for Mg$_2$CO$_4$-$Pnma$ and magnesite structures at 0 K.

The obtained elastic properties of Mg$_2$CO$_4$ and MgCO$_3$ are summarized in Table \ref{elastic_const} and Table \ref{moduli}.
Obtained values of $C_{ij}$, $B$, $G$, $V_p$, and $V_s$ for magnesite are in good agreement with the previous results of theoretical calculations \cite{li2020_mgco3}.
According to our results, the density and both bulk and shear moduli of Mg$_2$CO$_4$-$Pnma$ are higher than that of magnesite by 4-5 \%.
Orthocarbonate is similar to carbonate in sense of seismic velocities $V_p$ and $V_s$, but orthocarbonate is more anisotropic, owning higher universal anisotropy ($A^U$).
The value of $A^U$ for Mg$_2$CO$_4$-$Pnma$ is 0.4772, while that for magnesite is 0.2838.
